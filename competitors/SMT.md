  Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) is an area of automated deduction that studies methods for checking the satisfiability of first-order formulas with respect to some logical theory T of interest [BSST09]. What distinguishes SMT from general automated deduction is that the background theory T need not be finitely or even first-order axiomatizable, and that specialized inference methods are used for each theory. By being theory-specific and restricting their language to certain classes of formulas (such as, typically but not exclusively, quantifier-free formulas), these specialized methods can be implemented in solvers that are more efficient in practice than general-purpose theorem provers.

  While SMT techniques have been traditionally used to support deductive software verification, they have found applications in other areas of computer science such as, for instance, planning, model checking and automated test generation. Typical theories of interest in these applications include formalizations of various forms of arithmetic, arrays, finite sets, bit vectors, algebraic datatypes, strings, floating point numbers, equality with uninterpreted functions, and various combinations of these.
