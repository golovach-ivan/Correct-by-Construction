## SMT-LIB
SMT-LIB is an international initiative, coordinated by team and endorsed by a large number of research groups world-wide, aimed at facilitating research and development in [SMT](SMT.md). The main motivation of the SMT-LIB initiative was the expectation that the availability of **common standards** and of **a library of benchmarks** would greatly facilitate the evaluation and the comparison of SMT systems.

### ???
Like Version 2.0 and later versions, Version 2.6 defines:
- a language for writing **terms and formulas** in a sorted (i.e., typed) version of first-order logic;
- a language for specifying **background theories** and fixing a standard vocabulary of sort, function, and predicate symbols for them;
- a language for specifying **logics**, suitably restricted classes of formulas to be checked for satisfiability with respect to a specific background theory;
- a **command** language for interacting with SMT solvers via a textual interface that allows asserting and retracting formulas, querying about their satisfiability, examining their models or their unsatisfiability proofs, and so on.

### Underlying Logic
> SMT-LIB adopts as its underlying logic a version of many-sorted first-order logic with equality. Finally, in addition to the usual existential and universal quantifiers, the logic includes a **let** binder and a **match** binder analogous to constructs with the same name found in functional programming languages. The concrete syntax of the logic is part of the SMT-LIB language of formulas and theories.

### Background Theories
> One of the goals of the SMT-LIB initiative is to clearly define a catalog of background theories, starting with a small number of popular ones, and adding new ones as solvers for them are developed.

> This version of the SMT-LIB standard distinguishes between **basic theories** and **combined theories**. Basic theories, such as the theory of real numbers, the theory of arrays, the theory of fixed-size bit vectors and so on, are those explicitly defined in the SMT-LIB catalog. Combined theories are defined implicitly in terms of basic theories by means of a general modular combination operator.
