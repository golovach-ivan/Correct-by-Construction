In general, there are *furious air quotes* “three” “main” “ways” people write these specifications:
1. **Dependent types**: encode the specification into the type of the program. If it typechecks, it’s correct. Examples: Idris, Agda, F*.
2. **Contracts**: encode the specification as assertions, pre/post conditions, and refinement types. Examples: SPARK, Liquid Haskell, Dafny.
3. **Theorems**: write the specification as an independent mathematical theorem. Examples: Isabelle/HOL, ACL2.
