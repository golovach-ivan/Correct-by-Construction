A predicate is a Boolean-valued function P: X → {true, false}, called the predicate on X. Informally, a predicate is a statement that may be true or false depending on the values of its variables.

A predicate is not a statement and so it does not have a truth value. Whereas propositions are sentences, predicates are or can be parts of sentences. A predicate predicates something—a property—of something else that is sometimes called the ‘object’ or, sometimes, ‘subject’. Thus ‘is brilliant’ is a predicate.
