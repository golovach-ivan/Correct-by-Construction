Modal logic is a type of formal logic that extends classical propositional and predicate logic to include operators expressing modality. A modal — a word that expresses a modality — qualifies a statement. For example, the statement "John is happy" might be qualified by saying that John is usually happy, in which case the term "usually" is functioning as a modal.

- **Alethic** = indicate the possibility, impossibility and necessity of actions, states, events
- **Deontic** (proscriptive, prescriptive) = indicate what is prohibited, obligatory, or permitted.
- **Axiological** (ethics, aesthetics) = Ethics investigates the concepts of "right" and "good" in individual and social conduct. Aesthetics studies the concepts of "beauty" and "harmony."
- **Epistemic** = reflect the level of knowledge, ignorance and belief. is concerned with reasoning about knowledge.
- **Doxastic** = concerned with reasoning about beliefs. Typically, a doxastic logic uses Bx to mean "It is believed that x is the case". In doxastic logic, belief is treated as a modal operator.

Classical modal logic

A classical modal logic L is any modal logic containing (as axiom or theorem) the duality of the modal operators  
<>A == -[]-A  
[]A == -<>-A  

Thus it is possible that it will rain today if and only if it is not necessary that it will not rain today, and it is necessary that it will rain today if and only if it is not possible that it will not rain today.

Modal logic is characterized by the modal operators []P (box P) asserting that P is necessarily the case, and <>P (diamond P) asserting that P is possibly the case.
