Modal logic is a type of formal logic that extends classical propositional and predicate logic to include operators expressing modality. A modal — a word that expresses a modality — qualifies a statement. For example, the statement "John is happy" might be qualified by saying that John is usually happy, in which case the term "usually" is functioning as a modal.

- **Axiological** (ethics, aesthetics) = Ethics investigates the concepts of "right" and "good" in individual and social conduct. Aesthetics studies the concepts of "beauty" and "harmony."
- **Epistemic** = reflect the level of knowledge, ignorance and belief. is concerned with reasoning about knowledge.
- **Doxastic** = concerned with reasoning about beliefs. Typically, a doxastic logic uses Bx to mean "It is believed that x is the case". In doxastic logic, belief is treated as a modal operator.
