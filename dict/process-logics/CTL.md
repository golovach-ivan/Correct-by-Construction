CTL (Computation tree logic)

In 1981 E. M. Clarke and E. A. Emerson invented CTL and CTL model checking. CTL was first proposed by Edmund M. Clarke and E. Allen Emerson in 1981, who used it to synthesize so-called synchronisation skeletons, i.e abstractions of concurrent programs.
  
CTL is a [branching-time logic](process-logics/branching-time-logics.md).
  
CTL is in a class of [temporal logics](process-logics/temporal-logics.md).
