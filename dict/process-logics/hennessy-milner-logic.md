Hennessyâ€“Milner logic (HML) 

Is a dynamic logic used to specify properties of a labeled transition system (LTS). It was introduced in 1980 by Matthew Hennessy and Robin Milner in their paper "On observing nondeterminism and concurrency".

Another variant of the HML involves the use of recursion to extend the expressibility of the logic, and is commonly referred to as 'Hennessy-Milner Logic with recursion'. Recursion is enabled with the use of maximum and minimum fixed points.
