Is an extension of [modal logic](modal-logics.md) originally intended for reasoning about computer programs.
  
Dynamic logic extends modal logic by associating to every action 'a' the modal operators [a] and <a>, thereby making it a multimodal logic.

The meaning of [a]P is that after performing action 'a' it is necessarily the case that P holds, that is, 'a' must bring about P. 

The meaning of <a>P is that after performing 'a' it is possible that P holds, that is, 'a' might bring about P. 

These operators are related by 
- [a]P == -<a>-P
- <a>P == -[a]-P  
analogously to the relationship between the universal (???) and existential (???) quantifiers.
