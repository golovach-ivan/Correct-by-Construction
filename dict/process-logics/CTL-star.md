CTL*

CTL* was defined by E. A. Emerson and Joseph Y. Halpern in 1986.

CTL* is a superset of computational tree logic (CTL) and linear temporal logic (LTL).

CTL and LTL were developed independently before CTL*. Both sublogics have become standards in the model checking community, while CTL* is of practical importance because it provides an expressive testbed for representing and comparing these and other logics.	

The formal semantics of CTL* formulae  are defined with respect to some Kripke structure.

State formulae / Path formulae.
	
As the names imply, state formulae are interpreted with respect to the states of this structure, while path formulae are interpreted over paths on it.
