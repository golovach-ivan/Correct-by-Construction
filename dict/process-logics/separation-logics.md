separation logic, a novel extension of Hoare logic

A novel logical operation P âˆ— Q, called the **separating conjunction**, that asserts that P and Q hold for disjoint portions of the addressable storage.

A second, more general, advantage of separation logic is the support it gives to local reasoning, which underlies the scalability of the logic.
