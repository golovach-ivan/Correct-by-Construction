# Modal μ-calculus

 the modal μ-calculus (Lμ, μ-calculus) is an extension of propositional [modal logic](process-logics/modal-logics.md) ([with many modalities](process-logics/multimodal-logics.md)) by adding the least fixed point operator μ and the greatest fixed point operator ν, thus a [fixed-point logic](process-logics/fixed-point-logics.md).
