# Modal μ-calculus

The modal μ-calculus (Lμ, μ-calculus) is an extension of propositional [modal logic](process-logics/modal-logics.md) ([with many modalities](process-logics/multimodal-logics.md)) by adding the least fixed point operator μ and the greatest fixed point operator ν, thus a [fixed-point logic](process-logics/fixed-point-logics.md).
 
The (propositional, modal) μ-calculus originates with Dana Scott and Jaco de Bakker,[1] and was further developed by Dexter Kozen.

It is used to describe properties of labelled transition systems and for verifying these properties. Many temporal logics can be encoded in the μ-calculus, including CTL* and its widely used fragments—linear temporal logic and computational tree logic.
