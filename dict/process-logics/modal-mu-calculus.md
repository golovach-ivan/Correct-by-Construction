# Modal μ-calculus

### Def
The modal μ-calculus (Lμ, μ-calculus) is an extension of propositional [modal logic](process-logics/modal-logics.md) ([with many modalities](process-logics/multimodal-logics.md)) by adding the [least fixed point operator μ](../least-fixed-point.md) and the [greatest fixed point operator ν](../greatest-fixed-point.md), thus a [fixed-point logic](process-logics/fixed-point-logics.md). It is used to describe properties of labelled transition systems and for verifying these properties.
 
### History
The (propositional, modal) μ-calculus originates with Dana Scott and Jaco de Bakker, and was further developed by Dexter Kozen.

### Position
Many [temporal logics](temporal-logics.md) can be encoded in the μ-calculus, including [CTL*](CTL-star.md) and its widely used fragments—[linear temporal logic (LTL)](LTL.md) and [computational tree logic (CTL)](CTL.md).
