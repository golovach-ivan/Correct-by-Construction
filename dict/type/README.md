Typed Pi-calculi, explores the issue of assigning types to -calculus expressions.

## Untyped Pi-calculi



## Simple typed Pi-calculi

### Pi-calculi with recursive defs

### Polyadic Pi-calculi
A variant of the pi-calculus, the polyadic pi-calculus, is introduced, where tuples of names can be passed at synchronization time. Adding tuples in such a way forces the introduction of sorts, which intuitively ensure that synchronizing terms a gree as to the number of names that are being exchanged. This can be viewed as a primitive form of typing for the pi-calculus.


## Advanced type systems

### Linear Types
