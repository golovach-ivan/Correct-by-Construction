## Semaphore

Semaphore is a classic concurrency tool.

A counting semaphore. Conceptually, a semaphore maintains a set of permits. Each acquire() blocks if necessary until a permit is available, and then takes it. Each release() adds a permit, potentially releasing a blocking acquirer. 

Semaphores are often used to restrict the number of threads than can access some (physical or logical) resource.

In both versions structure the same
```
 contract Semaphore(@initPermits, acquire, release) = {
    new permits in {
      /* init permits */ |        
      
      contract acquire(ack) = { /* impl */ } |
      
      contract release(_) = { /* impl */ } 
    }
   } |
```
acquire - sync (with ack)
release - async (without ack)

### Attempt 1
Model permits count as items (Nil's) in channel
```
- {Nil, Nil}  // init with 2 permits
- {Nil}       // acquire()
- {}          // acquire() - empty, any new acquire() block on read
- {Nil}       // release()
- {Nil, Nil}  // release()
```

Init *permits* in loop with *initPermits* Nil elems
```
new n in {
  n!(initPermits) |
  for (@i <= n) {
    if (i > 0) { 
      permits!(Nil) | n!(i - 1) 
    }
  }
}        
```

acquire() impl
```
contract acquire(ack) = {
  for (_ <- permits) { ack!(Nil) }
}
```

release() impl
```
contract release(_) = {
  permits!(Nil)
} 
```
